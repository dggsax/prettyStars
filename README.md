# prettyStars
We needed to generate stars for my internship project at Microsoft and I couldn't find any node modules that I liked, so I wrote my own! The SVG path is based off of one found from a codepen, but the author is anonymous so I can't credit them.

** How to use it! **

At the top of any React file do `import PrettyStars from 'prettystars'`
Then just refer to the component as <PrettyStars /> 
(props description coming soon)
